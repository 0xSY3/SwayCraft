## Introduction

SwayCraft is an AI-powered development assistant specifically designed for the Fuel blockchain ecosystem. Built during the Encode x Fuel Hackathon, SwayCraft aims to streamline the development process for Fuel, making it easier for both newcomers and experienced developers to build efficient and secure smart contracts using Sway, Fuel's native smart contract language.

Unlike general-purpose AI tools, SwayCraft is tailored to understand the intricacies of Fuel's architecture and Sway's syntax, providing context-aware assistance that's directly applicable to Fuel blockchain development.

## Features

### 1. AI-Assisted Code Generation
- Generate Sway smart contract templates
- Provide Fuel-specific code snippets
- Offer explanations for generated code

### 2. Interactive AI Chat Assistant
- Answer Fuel and Sway-related questions
- Provide explanations on Fuel's unique features (e.g., predicates, UTXO model)
- Offer debugging assistance and best practices

### 3. Syntax Highlighting
- Real-time syntax highlighting for Sway code

### 4. Code Conversion (Planned)
- Convert pseudo-code to Sway
- Assist in migrating Solidity contracts to Sway

## Architecture

SwayCraft is built using a modern tech stack:

- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- State Management: Redux
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- AI Integration: OpenAI API and Anthropic's Claude API

The application follows a client-server architecture:

1. The React frontend handles user interactions and displays responses.
2. API requests are sent to our backend server.
3. The backend processes requests and interacts with AI services (OpenAI and Claude).
4. AI-generated responses are sent back to the frontend for display.

## Installation
